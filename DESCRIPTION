Description: Revisited clustering approaches to accommodate functional 
    data by allowing to jointly align the data during the clustering 
    process. Currently, shift, dilation and affine transformations 
    only are available to perform alignment. The k-mean algorithm has 
    been extended to integrate alignment and is fully parallelized. 
    Hierarchical clustering will soon be available as well.
