The [**fdacluster**](https://astamm.github.io/fdacluster/) package provides
implementations of the $k$-means, hierarchical agglomerative and DBSCAN
clustering methods for functional data. Variability in functional data is
intrinsically divided into three components: *amplitude*, *phase* and
*ancillary* variability. The first two sources of variability can be captured
with a dedicated statistical analysis that integrates a *curve alignment* step.
The $k$-means and HAC algorithms implemented in
[**fdacluster**](https://astamm.github.io/fdacluster/) provide clustering
structures that are based either on ampltitude variation (default behavior) or
phase variation. This is achieved by jointly performing clustering and alignment
of a functional data set. The three main related functions are
[`fdakmeans()`](https://astamm.github.io/fdacluster/reference/fdakmeans.html)
for the $k$-means,
[`fdahclust()`](https://astamm.github.io/fdacluster/reference/fdahclust.html)
for HAC and
[`fdadbscan()`](https://astamm.github.io/fdacluster/reference/fdadbscan.html)
for DBSCAN. The methods handle
**multivariate codomains**.

## Installation

You can install the official version from CRAN via:
``` r
install.packages("fdacluster")
```
or you can opt to install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:
``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("astamm/fdacluster")
```

## Example

### Data set

```{r load-pkg, echo=FALSE}
library(fdacluster)
```

Let us consider the following simulated example of $30$ $1$-dimensional curves:
```{r data, echo=FALSE}
matplot(t(simulated30$x), t(simulated30$y[, 1, ]), type = "l", xlab = "x", ylab = "y")
```

Looking at the data set, it seems that we shall expect $3$ groups if we aim at clustering based on phase variability but probably only $2$ groups if we search for a clustering structure based on amplitude variability.

### $k$-means based on amplitude variability

We can perform $k$-means clustering based on amplitude variability as follows:

```{r kmeans-amplitude-run}
out1 <- fdakmeans(
  simulated30$x,
  simulated30$y,
  seeds = c(1, 21),
  n_clusters = 2,
  centroid_type = "mean",
  warping_class = "affine",
  metric = "pearson", 
  cluster_on_phase = FALSE
)
```

All of
[`fdakmeans()`](https://astamm.github.io/fdacluster/reference/fdakmeans.html),
[`fdahclust()`](https://astamm.github.io/fdacluster/reference/fdahclust.html)
and
[`fdadbscan()`](https://astamm.github.io/fdacluster/reference/fdadbscan.html)
functions returns an object of class
[`caps`](https://astamm.github.io/fdacluster/reference/caps.html) (for
**C**lustering with
**A**mplitude and **P**hase **S**eparation) for which `S3` specialized methods
of
[`ggplot2::autoplot()`](https://astamm.github.io/fdacluster/reference/autoplot.caps.html)
and
[`graphics::plot()`](https://astamm.github.io/fdacluster/reference/plot.caps.html)
have been implemented. Therefore, we can visualize the results simply with:
```{r kmeans-amplitude-viz}
plot(out1, type = "amplitude")
plot(out1, type = "phase")
```

### $k$-means based on phase variability

We can perform $k$-means clustering based on phase variability only by switch
the `cluster_on_phase` argument to `TRUE`:

```{r kmeans-phase-run}
out2 <- fdakmeans(
  simulated30$x,
  simulated30$y,
  seeds = c(1, 11, 21),
  n_clusters = 3,
  centroid_type = "mean",
  warping_class = "affine",
  metric = "pearson", 
  cluster_on_phase = TRUE
)
```

We can inspect the result:
```{r kmeans-phase-viz}
plot(out2, type = "amplitude")
plot(out2, type = "phase")
```

We can perform similar analyses using HAC or DBSCAN instead of $k$-means. The
[**fdacluster**](https://astamm.github.io/fdacluster/) package also provides
visualization tools to help choosing the optimal number of cluster based on WSS
and silhouette values. This can be achieved by using a combination of the
functions
[`compare_caps()`](https://astamm.github.io/fdacluster/reference/compare_caps.html)
and
[`plot.mcaps()`](https://astamm.github.io/fdacluster/reference/plot.mcaps.html).
