<!-- badges: end -->

The [**fdacluster**](https://astamm.github.io/fdacluster/) package provides the
[`fdakmeans()`](https://astamm.github.io/fdacluster/reference/kma.html) function
that jointly performs clustering and alignment of a functional data set.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The package is linked against OpenMP and the BLAS and LAPACK libraries. Hence,
you will need to set up an appropriate development environment for the package
to install properly. Specifically:

- on Linux: it should be ready;
- on Windows: you should install [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools40.html);
- on macOS: you should refer to https://mac.r-project.org/tools/ and install the relevant tools.

### Installation

You can install the latest stable version of
[**fdacluster**](https://astamm.github.io/fdacluster/) from CRAN with:
``` r
install.packages("fdacluster")
```

Or you can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/astamm/fdacluster) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("astamm/fdacluster")
```

## Example

```{r example-simulated30}
library(fdacluster)

res <- fdakmeans(
  simulated30$x,
  simulated30$y,
  seeds = c(1, 21),
  n_clusters = 2,
  centroid_type = "medoid",
  warping_class = "affine",
  distance = "pearson"
)

plot(res, type = "amplitude")
plot(res, type = "phase")
```
